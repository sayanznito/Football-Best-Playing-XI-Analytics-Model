# Football-Best-Playing-XI-Analytics-Model
This is a Data Analysis Model for automation of a Football Best Playing XI using Python Data Science,Pandas,Seaborn,Numpy,PyPlot,Matplotlib.
I have used FIFA world Cup 2018 Dataset of players.Plotting and analyzing csv and automating a Best world XI.

Project Title- Football  Best XI Analysis Model  -(Python  Data  Science)
• Designed  an analysis model, to get the best playing eleven of a football tournament with the help of numpy ,pandas,matplotlib  libraries. 
• With the Fifa World Cup 2018 csv,the model analyse the best playing XI,from positions of players,goal and save statistics,both attack and defence.
Pandas gives us the proper data threading for the whole model. 
• With plots being used to determine the proper aspects of the players.the model eases the analysis.
